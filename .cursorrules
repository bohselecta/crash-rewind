# Cursor: Build CrashRewind MVP

- Use Node 20.x and pnpm.
- Ensure workspace TypeScript is used: **DO NOT** change versions.
  - Root has devDependency `typescript@5.6.3` and `overrides` forcing all packages to that version.
  - .vscode/settings.json points `typescript.tsdk` to the workspace.
  - After install, run `pnpm exec tsc -v` and expect `5.6.3`.
- Install workspace deps with `pnpm i` at repo root.
- Database: spin up Postgres via docker-compose (service: postgres).
- Run `pnpm prisma:migrate` to create schema; then `pnpm seed`.
- Start dev with `pnpm dev` (runs api, worker, and dashboard concurrently).
- If Next.js cache issues occur, delete `.next` and retry `pnpm dev`.
- If TypeScript path issues occur, ensure `tsconfig.base.json` is referenced by subprojects.
- During CI (future), use `pnpm -w -r build` and run minimal api tests with `vitest`.
