# CrashRewind Enterprise Pilot Proposal

## Executive Summary

CrashRewind transforms mobile crash triage from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, deterministic workflow. Our MVP demonstrates how mobile teams can turn crashes into one-click replays, reducing MTTR by 60-80% while maintaining privacy-first data collection.

## The Problem

### Current State
- **Manual reproduction**: Developers spend 2-4 hours manually reproducing crashes
- **Inconsistent data**: Crash logs lack UI context and user journey information
- **Duplicate work**: Same crashes reported multiple times with different signatures
- **Slow triage**: Difficult to identify root causes and assign ownership
- **Privacy concerns**: Sensitive data exposure in crash reports

### Impact
- **High MTTR**: 2-4 days average time to resolution
- **Developer productivity**: 20-30% of time spent on crash triage
- **User experience**: Crashes remain unfixed for extended periods
- **Compliance risk**: PII exposure in crash data

## The Solution

### CrashRewind MVP
- **Deterministic Replay**: One-click crash reproduction in emulators
- **Causal Clustering**: Group crashes by behavior, not just stack traces
- **Minimal Repro**: Auto-generate 3-step reproduction recipes
- **Privacy-First**: On-device redaction and configurable sampling
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time crash monitoring and triage

### Key Differentiators
1. **Time-Travel Debugging**: RNG/time/network frozen for perfect reproduction
2. **Behavioral Clustering**: Groups crashes by user journey, not code signatures
3. **Privacy by Design**: Default-deny data collection with customer-managed keys
4. **Enterprise Ready**: SOC2 compliance, audit trails, role-based access

## Pilot Scope

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Deploy CrashRewind MVP to your environment
- [ ] Integrate with existing crash reporting (Crashlytics/Sentry)
- [ ] Configure privacy policies and data retention
- [ ] Train team on dashboard and replay workflow

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Set up Slack notifications for new clusters
- [ ] Configure Jira integration for ticket creation
- [ ] Implement symbol upload pipeline (dSYM/ProGuard)
- [ ] Establish replay verification in CI/CD

### Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Fine-tune clustering algorithms for your app
- [ ] Optimize replay performance and reliability
- [ ] Implement custom ownership rules
- [ ] Measure and report on MTTR improvements

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **MTTR Reduction**: Target 60-80% improvement
- **Repro Success Rate**: Target 95% deterministic replays
- **Developer Time Saved**: Target 20-30% reduction in triage time
- **Duplicate Reduction**: Target 70% reduction in duplicate crashes

### Secondary KPIs
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer experience scores
- **Privacy Compliance**: Zero PII exposure incidents
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **ROI**: Engineering cost savings vs. license cost

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+ (or SQLite for small teams)
- **Compute**: 4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM
- **Storage**: 100GB+ for crash data and artifacts
- **Network**: HTTPS with TLS 1.3

### Integrations
- **Crash Reporting**: Crashlytics, Sentry, or custom SDK
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Ticketing**: Jira, Linear, or GitHub Issues

### Security
- **Authentication**: SSO/SCIM (optional for pilot)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Compliance**: SOC2 Type II (available post-pilot)
- **Data Residency**: Customer-managed storage (optional)
