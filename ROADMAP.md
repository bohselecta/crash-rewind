# CrashRewind Roadmap

## Current Status: MVP ✅

The current MVP demonstrates the core concept of deterministic crash replay with:
- Crash ingestion and clustering
- Basic replay queue (stubbed)
- Admin dashboard with brand identity
- Privacy-first data collection
- SQLite database with sample data

## Phase 1: Production Readiness (Q2 2025)

### Real Emulator Integration
- **Android Emulator gRPC**: Replace stubbed replay worker with actual Android emulator orchestration
- **Xcode simctl**: iOS simulator integration for deterministic replays
- **Environment Pinning**: OS version, device model, memory, storage, time skew
- **Network Virtualization**: Use captured cassettes for deterministic network behavior

### Step Minimization
- **Delta-Debugging Service**: Automatically reduce repro steps from 10 taps to 3 taps
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify which steps are essential for crash reproduction
- **Minimal Repro Generation**: Generate human-readable repro recipes

### Symbol Pipelines
- **dSYM Upload**: iOS symbol upload via CI/CD
- **ProGuard Mapping**: Android obfuscation mapping
- **Source Context**: Show relevant code snippets in crash details
- **Stack Trace Enhancement**: Better stack trace analysis and grouping

## Phase 2: Intelligence & Automation (Q3 2025)

### Ownership Inference
- **Codeowners Integration**: Map crashes to owning teams
- **Stack Analysis**: Analyze stack traces to suggest likely owners
- **File Path Analysis**: Use file paths to infer team ownership
- **Auto-Routing**: Automatically assign crashes to appropriate teams

### Advanced Clustering
- **Behavioral Similarity**: Cluster by UI behavior patterns, not just stack traces
- **Causal Analysis**: Identify root causes and dependencies
- **Regression Detection**: Detect when fixes introduce new issues
- **Impact Scoring**: Calculate business impact (users × frequency × journey)

### CI/CD Integration
- **Replay Verification**: Run replays against candidate builds
- **Release Gates**: Block releases with new P0 clusters
- **Regression Testing**: Verify fixes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track replay performance and reliability

## Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Q4 2025)

### Advanced Security & Compliance
- **SSO/SCIM**: Enterprise identity management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Data Residency**: Customer-managed data storage
- **Compliance Packs**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA compliance features

### Advanced Analytics
- **MTTR Tracking**: Measure and improve mean time to resolution
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns and predict issues
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate engineering time saved
- **ROI Metrics**: Demonstrate value to stakeholders

### Integrations
- **Jira/Linear**: Bi-directional ticket management
- **Slack/Teams**: Advanced notification and collaboration
- **PagerDuty**: Incident management integration
- **DataDog/New Relic**: APM integration

## Phase 4: AI & ML (Q1 2026)

### Fix Assistant
- **Code Analysis**: Analyze crash patterns and suggest fixes
- **Test Generation**: Generate unit tests from crash scenarios
- **Root Cause Analysis**: AI-powered root cause identification
- **Fix Validation**: Verify fixes before deployment

### Predictive Analytics
- **Crash Prediction**: Predict crashes before they happen
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess release risk based on changes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in crash data
- **Capacity Planning**: Predict infrastructure needs

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Performance
- **Replay Optimization**: Faster emulator startup and execution
- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL optimization and sharding
- **Caching**: Redis integration for better performance
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for assets

### Developer Experience
- **SDK Improvements**: Better mobile SDKs with more capture points
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and integration docs
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line tools for developers
- **IDE Extensions**: VS Code extensions for crash analysis

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Metrics**: Prometheus/Grafana integration
- **Logging**: Structured logging with ELK stack
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting for system issues

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- 95% replay success rate
- <30 second replay execution time
- 50% reduction in manual repro time
- 10+ enterprise pilot customers

### Phase 2 Goals
- 80% automatic ownership assignment accuracy
- 60% reduction in duplicate crashes
- 40% improvement in MTTR
- 25+ enterprise customers

### Phase 3 Goals
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- 90% customer satisfaction score
- 100+ enterprise customers
- $10M+ ARR
