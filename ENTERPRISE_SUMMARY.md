# CrashRewind Enterprise Summary

## Transform Mobile Crash Triage with Deterministic Replay

**CrashRewind** turns mobile crashes into one-click, deterministic replays in emulators/simulators with the exact UI steps, inputs, network responses, and device context that led to the crash.

---

## The Problem
- **Manual reproduction**: 2-4 hours per crash
- **Inconsistent data**: Missing UI context and user journey
- **Duplicate work**: Same crashes reported multiple times
- **Slow triage**: Difficult root cause identification
- **Privacy risk**: PII exposure in crash reports

## The Solution
- **Deterministic Replay**: One-click crash reproduction
- **Causal Clustering**: Group by behavior, not stack traces
- **Minimal Repro**: Auto-generate 3-step recipes
- **Privacy-First**: On-device redaction, configurable sampling
- **Enterprise Ready**: SOC2, SSO/SCIM, audit trails

## ROI Calculator

**Example**: 10,000 replays/year Ã— 2 hours saved Ã— $120/hour = **$2.4M value**

**Depot B cost**: $180,000/year = **13Ã— ROI** before MTTR/CSAT benefits

## Key Differentiators

âœ… **Time-Travel Debugging**: RNG/time/network frozen for perfect reproduction  
âœ… **Behavioral Clustering**: Groups by user journey, not code signatures  
âœ… **Privacy by Design**: Default-deny with customer-managed keys  
âœ… **ANR/OOM Focus**: First-class ANR timelines and OOM heuristics  
âœ… **CI Integration**: Verify-replay gate blocks bad releases  
âœ… **Crashlytics Bridge**: Ingest free events for deterministic replays  
âœ… **Enterprise Ready**: SOC2, audit trails, role-based access
